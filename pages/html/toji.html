              <p class="card__description">A special grade cursed tool that embodies pure and solid power. It originally belonged to Toji, and he got it back from Maki Zenin after he was resurrected. In Toji's hands, the three-section staff reflected his incredible physical strength, making a weapon capable of destroying even Dagon's hardest shikigami with a single blow.</p>

            <p class="card__description">It was a large Japanese broadsword with a fur tsuba and a dark handle. It bypasses physical toughness and cuts directly at the soul. Coupled with Toji's physical talent, this weapon was able to cut through several of Suguru's curses, including the Rainbow Dragon, which had the hardest skin among all his curses</p>

          <p class="card__description">The trade-off for Toji's complete lack of cursed energy is his immense physical prowess. While it has been noted that several people have had Heavenly Restrictions that bring their cursed energy to normal levels, Toji is the only case where it has erased the person's cursed energy completely.</p>

          <p class="card__description">Toji has a cursed spirit that can store many different objects within its body. Toji can freely interchange his weapons by putting them in and taking them out of the curse's mouth. The curse can shrink itself within its own body, allowing Toji to ingest it so people can't detect the curse energy it emits.</p>
