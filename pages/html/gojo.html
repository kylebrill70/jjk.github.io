              <p class="card__description">Six Eyes is also an Innate Technique inherited through the Gojo family. Yuta has stated that the Six Eyes allows Satoru to reduce his cursed energy consumption from technique activation infinitesimally near to nothing, and that he will never run out of cursed energy in a fight as a result.</p>

          <p class="card__description">Red has the opposite effect. Using his reversal technique to invert the properties of Blue, Satoru activates the divergence of his infinity and causes an extremely powerful repulsive force, repelling all matter in its vicinity.</p>

          <p class="card__title">Lapse Blue</p>
          <p class="card__description">The reinforced version of the neutral limitless; Blue is the byproduct of Gojo amplifying the Limitless and negative energy, producing a vacuum. Through these, Gojo creates a scenario where the world itself is forced to correct itself and fill in the negative space, causing all matter in the range of the commanded space to be pulled together.</p>

          <p class="card__title">Infinity</p>
          <p class="card__description">Being the neutral form of the Limitless, the Infinity is commonly known as the ability to stop, although this is a common misconception as the true power of the Infinity is to slow things down.</p>

          <p class="card__title">Limitless</p>
          <p class="card__description">At the base level, Limitless is an innate technique which is derived from the Gojo family. This technique grants its users nigh-absolute control over space through cursed energy manipulation at an atomic level, resulting in multiple subsequent results and techniques within the overall ability.</p>
